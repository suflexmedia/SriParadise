Overall intent:
The cover page must feel international, global, sophisticated, and aspirational.
It should not look rushed, generic, or brochure-like.
The emotional reference is luxury fashion / couture-level refinement, not corporate clutter.
VISUALS
Create a collage of attractive images.


Replace the current hospitality image with a high-end, classy luxury hospitality visual.
(international resort / premium destination aesthetic; not generic stock)


Replace the movie/cinema image with a more creative, cinematic, international film visual


Option to create 2–3 alternate cover versions with different image treatments


Visuals should feel global, not India-centric
